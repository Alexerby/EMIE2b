    \section*{Introduction}
    As of writing this paper the American Congress is dealing with another debt crisis where the Joe
    Biden Administrationis negotiating with the speaker of the House of Represenatatives Kevin Mc-
    Carthy about raising the national debt ceiling of \$31,4T in order to not default on its current debt.
    In reality, the United States hit its debt ceiling already, in January this year, but have been able to
    move assets and provide enough liquidity to not default. However, the method of shuffling existing
    resources is not sustainable in the long run and if the administration and the Republicans do not
    strike a deal by next week we will find ourselves in a financial crisis making the economic impact of
    theCorona-pandemic seem like a breeze in comparison.

    When the Standard \& Poors 500 indice dove 35,92%1 in 32 business days Fed had no choice but
    to react, and the response involved implementing quantitative easing and balance sheet operations,
    which effectively expanded the money supply 5 times over the following twelve months.

    In Sweden, the monetary policy of the Riksbank have not been as expansive as the policy of Fed.
    However, Corona naturally had an immense impact and an expansive monetary policy was also
    here unevitable. Some of the monetary policies here included loans of 500BSEK to swedish banks,
    purchasing of securities of up to 300BSEK and in addition to that offering of loans in USD.2 Despite
    the relatively moderate monetary policies implemented by the Riksbank, there was a notable increase
    in the money supply. This occurred during the period of persistently low interest rates that prevailed
    during 2020. Commercial banks found it advantageous to borrow from the Riksbank to effectively
    utilize the fractional reserve banking system, which in turn had an impact on the M1 money supply.

    This paper aims to examine the conventional economic dogma that asserts a positive relationship
    between the money supply and inflationary pressure. To accomplish this, vector autoregressive
    models and impulse response functions will be employed for analysis.

    \section*{Data}
    We have in the study selected monthly data from Statistics Swedens ”Statistikdatabasen” for money
    supply measured in M1 and the annual change in consumer price index (i.e. inflation). The data
    span is limited to between January 2004 to November 2022, giving us 232 observations. The chosen
    time limitation is not arbitrary but is based on the available data. In this case, the first
    observation for the M1 variable is in January 2004, while the last observation for both our variables
    is in April 2023, as obtained from Statistics Sweden’s ”Statistikdatabas.” By using this time range,
    the aim is to include as much of the variance in the dataset as possible, considering the available
    data points.

    \section*{Empirical process and Results}
    \subsection*{Rationale for Incorporation of a Trend Model}
    Before exposing our data to any tests, we need to evaluate what type of model we are going 
    to use throughout our analysis. I am here going to argue that in the context of inflation and money 
    supply both variables have a deterministic trend component, this due to two factors. Firstly inflation
    is not considered a stochastic process since changes in other economic variables such as changes
    in monetary policy, supply and demand dynamics, and the fiscal policies have an impact on the change in 
    prices. Secondly, since M1 represents the most liquid form of money, this money will reasonably be 
    highly influenced by the Riksbanks monetary policy, fiscal policy and the underlying economic condition.
    Therefore, I argue that this variable should not be considered stochastic.\footnote{We can also see
    that our variables, particularly M1, does exhibit a pattern of trend when looking at the decomposition
    of the timeseries (figure 1.1 and 1.2), advancing the proposition of using a model with trend.}

    \subsection*{Assessing Model Validity: Diagnostic Testing for VAR Analysis}

        \paragraph*{Residual Analysis} is performed using the \textit{autocorrelation function} and 
        \textit{Ljung-Box test}.The autocorrelation function shows us a strong autocorrelation in as well
        inflation as in M1 supply. The autocorrelation in inflation, in contrast, exhibits a considerably 
        more rapid decrease compared to the autocorrelation in M1. A significant autocorrelation in inflation 
        is exhibited for approximately one year, where as the autocorrelation in M1 is shown to last much longer,
        approximately 5 years.\footnote{Figure not in included.} When performing a Ljung-Box test we can confirm that 
        the model does exhibit autocorrelation with a p-value of 1.182e-04, which is noticeably below our significance 
        level used throughout this analysis of 5\%.

        \paragraph*{Model Fit and Assumptions} must be confirmed using a Jarque-Bera test. Here we examine whether 
        the model is exercising a normal distribution ($H_0: JB = 0$), or if we can see that our variables are exercising
        a distribution which is not normally distributed.
